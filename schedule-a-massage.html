        You are invited to use our lot, including the 15 min spots!

        When I’m Available
      </div>
      <p>
        Apologies, but we are booking afternoons about 8 weeks out right now! We expect this to change in 
        the next few months. In the meantime, thanks for all your incredible participation & helping us thrive. 
        We can’t wait to help you feel your best as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we can we provide & update a couple of weeks of available spots in real time, though at very busy 
        times we may not be able to. We prefer a personal approach to booking as we are both thorough & easy 
        to schedule with by phone, (or email & voice note in some cases), & via text subsequent to initial session.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anything you do find below is a combination of a true & a preferred schedule, so please inquire if 
        you don’t see a slot that you would like, in case something has changed or we can otherwise accommodate.
