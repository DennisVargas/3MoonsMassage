      <p class="lead">
        It is with regret that we must postpone delivery of our services, as our lead massage therapist has received very poor treatment for an 
        otherwise well-understood condition, that by its nature is for some reason, ignored by the medical community.
      </p>

        We regret to inform you that we must temporarily pause our massage services. Our lead massage therapist is currently 
        undergoing treatment for a condition that has been widely misunderstood by the medical community, known as Craniocervical 
        Junction Injury(CCJ) & Instability(CCI).
      </p> -->
      <p>
        In the process, though, we have learned an immense amount about Craniocervical Junction (CCJ) injuries & Instability (CCI) from our 
        lead practitioner being injured in this way! & will never stop trying to get back to being of any help we can in this, and other 
        uncommonly misunderstood myoskeletal conditions, in the future.
      </p>
      <!-- edited version -->
      <!-- <p>
        In the course of this challenging journey, we've gained invaluable insights into these myoskeletal conditions, and we are 
        determined to continue our mission to help those who are affected by these lesser known health issues in the future. Recovery 
        has been slow, and in some cases, seemingly impossible. What's often overlooked is the fact that when certain vertebrae are 
        misaligned, especially with weakened ligaments, it can put pressure on the spinal cord, and in some cases, even the brain 
        stem.
      </p> -->      
      <p>
        Unfortunately, recovery has been rendered quite slow, if not impossible. Unfortunately, what's ignored about this condition is the 
        fact that if you have a vertebra that is too far out, especially with weakened ligaments, this greatly increases the likelihood 
        that the vertebra puts pressure on the spinal cord. What is commonly known, those strangely ignored, which we have just discovered, 
        is that not only is the spinal cord not much smaller than the space it passes through, but particularly if those vertebrae are just 
        under the skull, what will result is brain stem pressure. And since the brain stem and the vagus nerve, which also passes quite in the 
        same area govern autonomic function, and their pressurizing activates the sympathetic nervous system constantly, the parasympathetic 
        is inhibited. Another fact we've just discovered, is that the constant activation of the sympathetic nervous system literally makes 
        healing impossible. Meaning that such patients have to be told to stop everything they're doing that's causing the brain stem pressure; 
        otherwise, they run the actual serious risk of losing their life due to resulting financial instability, not to mention if they weren't 
        in great shape beforehand. Luckily, our lead was an athlete and devoted student of dance lifelong, so she has a somewhat increased chance 
        of maybe being able to defeat this injury one day. But after so many years of insufficient and misinformation, the possibility is indeed 
        greatly reduced.
      </p>

      <!-- <p>
        What's crucial to understand is that this pressure can activate the sympathetic nervous system constantly, inhibiting the 
        parasympathetic system and making healing nearly impossible. This means that patients must take steps to reduce brain stem 
        pressure to avoid serious consequences, not only to their health but also their financial stability.
      </p> -->      
      <p>
        We may, if we're able, set up a Patreon to help facilitate the possibility that she can render some kind of missing education or even 
        Consulting about this condition, hopefully to those with cranial cervical instability, and maybe even Physicians, or online through the 
        new mediums that are available. Please stay tuned via Facebook if you would like to support this work. We truly believe what we found about 
        this condition is probably, to a lesser degree, rampant, and with much better treatment, could literally save a country billions of dollars 
        in unnecessary Healthcare conditions in Lost productivity in its citizens. This condition is really very basic, yet the Cascade of symptoms 
        starts with constant pain and anxiety, and eventually leads to an inability to maintain any kind of good sleeping habits, and increasing inability 
        to digest food, to hold on to objects, and to maintain any kind of productivity that requires the head to be weight-bearing- which is basically 
        absolutely anything a person can do. There is currently virtually no guidance about this condition in terms of physical therapy; most chiropractors 
        don't even know that they don't, from our understanding, adjust the upper 2 vertebrae.

        We're exploring the possibility of setting up a Patreon to facilitate education and consulting about this condition. We 
        believe that increased awareness and proper treatment could save a significant amount in healthcare costs and lost 
        productivity. The symptoms of CCJ injury & instability range from constant pain and anxiety to difficulties sleeping, 
        digesting food, and maintaining daily activities.
      </p> -->      
      <p>
        There is, however, a chiropractic specialization that adjusts the upper two vertebrae. But its practitioners are very uncommon, 
        and among physicians, awareness of the conditions seems to be virtually non-existent; it could save the country. Feel free to 
        reach out if you believe you suffer from the same! We may likely have to respond via voice note, as extended conversation is 
        not often possible, and it must be clear that while informed by my profession, such information given must be understood to come from 
        my capacity as a private citizen. Temporarily Archived in expectation of our return soon! Relieve pain & tension effectively, or 
        bask in Hot Stone, Aroma & other Hydrotherapy applications & deep relaxation, with a therapist devoted to you, not a busy spa schedule. 
        Or how about both?! like to do feel-good work that has the benefits of both Sports/Medical/Deep Tissue Massage, & Intuitive, Relaxing, 
        Energetic Bodywork, without the pain you might expect from deep tissue While pure Relaxation.

        At present, there is limited guidance on physical therapy for this condition, and most chiropractors are not versed in 
        adjusting the upper two vertebrae. Specialized chiropractors exist but are rare. Awareness of the condition among physicians 
        is minimal.
      </p> 
      <p>
        If you suspect you might be experiencing similar issues, please reach out to us. Although we may need to respond via voice note 
        due to the limitations of extended conversation, we are dedicated to providing support.
      </p>
      <p>
        While our services are temporarily on hold, we are committed to returning soon. In the meantime, we encourage you to stay 
        updated through our Facebook page for any developments related to our work.
      </p>
      <p>
        At 3 Moons Massage, we specialize in relieving pain and tension effectively, and we offer indulgent treatments such as 
        Hot Stone, Aroma, and other Hydrotherapy applications for deep relaxation. Our therapist is dedicated to providing a 
        personalized experience, in contrast to the busy schedules of large spas. Whether you seek the benefits of Sports, Medical, 
        Deep Tissue Massage or prefer a soothing, intuitive, and energetic bodywork session, we offer it all without the discomfort 
        often associated with deep tissue massage. Your well-being is our top priority.

        from our lead practitioner being injured in this way! We will continue to be of great help in this 
        uncommonly understood condition in the future. Due to poor treatment & medical misinformation 
        in the initial & mid-term seeking of recovery, it was not understood that what had occurred was a much 
        more serious injury than was communicated by her healthcare team. Recovery has been rendered 
        quite slow. Please understand the following as pertinent to future treatment. Feel free to reach out

        Relieve pain & tension, effectively, or bask in Hot Stone, Aroma & other Hydrotherapy applications & deep relaxation,
        with a therapist devoted to you, not a busy spa schedule. Or how about both? I like to do feel-good work that has the
        benefits of both Sports/Medical/Deep Tissue Massage, & Intuitive, Relaxing, Energetic Bodywork, without the pain you
        might expect from deep tissue. While pure Relaxation Massage can lack the depth to make real change, bodywork with a
        total focus on attacking problem areas can be so painful it tells the body to hold back. The absolute comfort of deep
        relaxation is the place where the body knows it can stay and heal, where the adrenals that maintain patterns of tension
        stop production, instead of reactivating through painful techniques your body braces against all over again. I call my
        practice 3 Moons because I see bodywork from a 3-fold core foundation, made up of the Anatomical know-how of Western Science, 
        thousands of years of testing the efficacy of practice that’s given rise to the Knowledge & many modalities practiced today 
        (which is also Science – just from a different point-of-view!), and the Intuition that found them that, thru wellness, 
        saves, not existences perhaps, but lives, full of the well-being that living requires; for we are not truly living if 
        we are not well. For those who like to read more before making a decision, please do on my Techniques page – I believe 
        an understanding of healing makes it more effective, & I love talking about massage almost as much as I love doing it.
      </p>
        <p>May you be well, and may we make you even better,</p>
        <p>See you soon,</p>
