    <h3>Meet Alexandra</h3>
    <p>
      Hello, and welcome. It is with regret that we must postpone delivery of our services, 
      though we have learned an immense amount about Craniocervical Junction (CCJ) injuries & Instability (CCI)
      from our lead practitioner being injured in this way! & will continue to be of great help in this 
      uncommonly understood condition in the future. But due to poor treatment & medical misinformation 
      in the initial & mid-term seeking of recovery, it was not understood that what had occurred was a much 
      more serious injury than was communicated by her healthcare team. Recovery has been rendered 
      quite slow. Please understand the following as pertinent to future treatment. Feel free to reach out 
      if you believe you suffer from the same! We may likely have to respond via voice note, as extended 
      conversation is not often possible, & must be clear that while informed by my profession,
      such information given must be understood to come from my capacity as a private citizen.

      Temporarily Archived in expectation of our return soon!
      Relieve pain & tension, effectively, or bask in Hot Stone, Aroma & other Hydrotherapy applications & deep relaxation, 
      with a therapist devoted to you, not a busy spa schedule. Or how about both?I like to do feel-good work that has the 
      benefits of both Sports/Medical/Deep Tissue Massage, & Intuitive, Relaxing, Energetic Bodywork, without the pain you 
      might expect from deep tissue.While pure Relaxation Massage can lack the depth to make real change, bodywork with a 
      total focus on attacking problem areas can be so painful it 
      tells the body to hold back. The absolute comfort of deep relaxation is the place where the body knows it can stay and 
      heal, where the adrenals that maintain patterns of tension 
      stop production, instead of reactivating through painful techniques your body braces against all over again.I call my 
      practice 3 Moons because I see bodywork from a 3-fold core 
      foundation, made up of the Anatomical know-how of Western Science, thousands of years of testing the efficacy of practice 
      that’s given rise to the Knowledge & many modalities 
      practiced today (which is also Science – just from a different point-of-view!), and the Intuition that found them that, 
      thru wellness, saves, not existences perhaps, but lives, 
      full of the well-being that living requires; for we are not truly living if we are not well. For those who like to read 
      more before making a decision, please do on my Techniques 
      page – I believe an understanding of healing makes it more effective, & I love talking about massage almost as much as 
      I love doing it.

      May you be well, and may we make you even better,

      See you soon,

      Alexandra Myers, LMT 13978
