        Specials & Ways to Earn Extra Time
        Friday 11/11 – (Extra) 10% for Veterans! – Just bring your Military Id!
        Extra time special
        Just ask! 15% extra minutes/10% off your introductory session that ends by 4:45pm on a weekday & starts at 10am or later.
        
        Helpful Things/Time-Savers I Can Pass On To You As Extra Table-Time**/Requirements for Specials/Budgetary Concerns
        
        If you’d like some extra time without using a special, our best bet for your best session is to have an idea of a 
        range of what you’d feel most comfortable spending, & what you would spend if you were getting work that was 
        particularly meeting your needs. Then I also provide up to 20% extra minutes if you can do any or all of the following:
        
        Be on time (this includes the 10 minutes in advance so we get you on the table on time);
        
        Schedule cooperatively if possible, so that we’re not up against other appointments.
        
        *Paying in cash – This helps but is not required
        
        Never no-show! Be honest in making a commitment to your session time. Let me know truthfully if your 
        session time is tentative,/as soon as you do if something comes up to make your appointment tentative, 
        & make sure to allot sufficient time to make that commitment a reality.
        
        The biggest gimme though is one that represents 10% of those bonus minutes if you can bring your own 
        linens, though you must let me know as soon as you do that you’re bringing them – there’s more than 
        just sheets for the full amount, as well as making sure I don’t already have some on when you arrive;) 
        Please note as some have asked, this is not mandatory! just something I offer.
        
        If you’d like to bring your own sheets but don’t have any, for extra minutes after the first session, 
        take over a set of my sheets, & if you’d like more towards the full 10% extra time just bring any part 
        of the rest – which is 2 pillows & a small towel, or vice versa, & a washcloth.
        
        Arrive moisturized, with basically clean feet if possible (I know we walk on them, &:
        
        Low-stress:) These things make our time more about the work/get more of it accomplished!
        
        Polite & respectful, & no *weird stuff.
        
        Thanks for reading & hope to meet you soon,
