I discovered myself as a healer 10 years ago last year, when a friend laid hands on another friend to relieve a headache, and I realized I could do the same.Two years later, on an island off of Cape Cod, I became a Reiki practitioner, moving quickly to the 2nd level. I am looking for the right person to bring me to the Master levelâ€¦

My first love was dance, and have practiced modern and other forms for 20+ years already! I also love a lot of sports, music, the outdoors, travel, humor, and humanitarian work.

I am also a Psychology Student at Portland State University. I plan to continue manual massage healing for another 10-15 years or more, and start Social Work, & then Counseling, first with traumatized children, & then adult survivors, within the next few years.
