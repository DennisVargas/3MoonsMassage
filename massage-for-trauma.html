        Greetings & thanks for reading here about my openness to hear whatever comes up for folks as we do our work together, 
        based on my burgeoning career as a cross-culturally & spiritually informed mental health therapist.
      </p>
      <p>
        As many who explore & work to improve their physical health know, it is very 
        much connected to our mental, emotional & spiritual health. For those whose belief 
        systems/mental map include this perspective it is of monumental importance to 
        connect all these parts of our mysterious wholes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given the seriousness of that work, much of this page is dedicated however 
        to making sure to speak to the fact of my not being currently trained as a 
        licensed mental health therapist, yet what the above means to me as a 
        trauma-informed bodywork provider. Thank you in advance for your clarity
        in reading all of the following as to what I am offering if you choose 
        to use the space in this way.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a B.S. in Psychology, that I started at the University of Oregon & completed at 
        Portland State University. I am working towards becoming a shamano-spiritually trained Mental Health Life Coach. 
        As of now I have taken a set of 5 coaching training sessions, & have made various entres into different 
        spiritual communities, such as the Dharmapunx, an all-ages Pagan Spirituality group, various classes & confidantes, 
        & a local Blackfoot Sundance community. I also have certifications as a 
        Nami Connections Support Group Facilitator and in Body-Mind Centered Hakomi.
      </p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">
        After much work & research & seeing how difficult it can be for sufferers of 
        differing levels of mental illness to receive sufficient, well-rounded, informed care 
        in many relevant issues of health, I would like my clients to know that mine is a safe 
        space; To disclose trauma & mental health issues, especially as they pertain to the bodywork 
        they receive, & to open the space to discussion that includes the spiritual realm & distressing life events.
      </p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">
        Issues pertaining to the treatment of true mental illness, especially more serious forms 
        pertaining to intense &/or chronic childhood or ongoing abuse, schizophreniform & major mood 
        disorders such as bipolar mania, are however best addressed with a fully trained clinician. 
        I hope I may be able to do any small part to direct folks to & encourage mental health 
        treatment to anyone who is suffering this much. There is good help, though sometimes we 
        have to be thorough & work hard to calm ourselves & keep looking.
      </p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">
        Especially after recent changes, it is mandatory, as well as responsible, to be clear 
        that one cannot (by-definition) do or claim to do what is legally considered talk therapy, 
        without licensure in the state of Oregon, which requires a Master’s level certificate as well. 
        I, again, hold only a B.S. in Psychology, & am not a licensed therapist of the Oregon Board of 
        Licensed Counselors & Therapists, or of any other such licensing agency.
      </p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">
        However, as it may be even particularly difficult for those with non-existent or less ample 
        insurance plans, or perhaps even comfort with the overall field of mental health, especially 
        in a pinch or sufficiently conveniently, to talk with anyone about troubling issues, & that 
        musculo-skeletal pain often accompanies mental & emotional stress, I have decided to intentionally 
        open my practice space – during bodywork sessions – to sharing & discussion as a non-clinical, holistic healer.
      </p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">
        For the benefit of your bodywork I must only ask that the following is understood & strictly honored:
      </p>
      <ul style="font-weight: bold;">
        <li>The time limit of your session Must still be respected, both during & after.</li>
        <li>That for the purposes of the actual session that I am providing, that this is still just a bodywork session.</li>
        <li>
          That you note, on your own, & continually during any sharing, that a great deal of 
          talk during your session may impede the flow of the bodywork. While I can & may help, 
          I ask my clients to be mindful that they are co-creating their healing experience with me.
        </li>
        <li>If I hear of any impending violence a client is planning on committing I will need 
          to close the session while requiring full payment for it.</li>
        <li>
          That this is a way you can use your healing space & time with me, but it is not an 
          additional service that I provide for a fee. If it is helpful & easy or possible for you to do so, all bodyworkers accept ‘tips’ as part of overall compensation & 
          encouragement towards them of going above & beyond the normal & customary expectations 
          of the service they are providing and current career description, & even help in achieving their future goals.
        </li>
        <li>
          That by sharing sensitive information you should always be aware that even in settings 
          with a licensed talk therapist, frustrations & emotions may rise to uncomfortable levels, 
          & only you can communicate this. As such sharing with me will all or mostly lack eye contact, 
          this has even more likelihood of occurring, without my even immediately knowing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">
        With someone who is not a mental health professional such as myself, the two of us may 
        well be less or even ill-equipped to bring these feelings down to more manageable levels, 
        especially if your feelings & needs for help around them are significant & related intrinsically 
        to sharing them. Please be aware that I cannot even take responsibility for what comes up in 
        the realm of mental health even to the extent that a licensed counselor can, which even true 
        therapists cannot do an an absolute level. However, they may likely do so more skillyfully than 
        someone less trained such as myself. I can hereby only offer to provide space for you to discuss issues 
        that you feel comfortable sharing
      </p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">
        As well I am concerned about affordability as I say in my scheduling page, I can recommend the 
        Lewis & Clark & River Place Community Counseling Centers as inexpensive options to receive 
        supervised student therapy as well. They provide these therapy sessions on an ongoing basis for a 
        few months at a time (with each clinician-in-training) during student internships, for modest amounts 
        set according to self-declared income. They cannot however take insurance payments or provide medication 
        assistance, or help in a crisis.
      </p>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;">
        Thanks in advance for your understanding & the pursuit of your highest self, as we can only do 
        through learning & healing ourselves at our highest & deepest levels,
      </p>
